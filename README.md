Extentsion of HW9 with MazeCreator

HW9 is maze solver with DFS. Rather than just using testcases given to us, we created a way to create our own solvable random mazes. We did the maze solver is pure random, and it leads to possible unsolvable mazes and in order to create solvable maze, after every time we create a maze, we test to see if it is solvable with HW9 code and if it is not solvable it repeates the make maze proccess until we get a solvable maze. Finally, it writes the new generated maze into a file in mazes folder for reference.
